"""Guess the type
To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function. Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of a, simply execute:

type(a)
We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c. You can use the IPython shell on the right to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?"""

a = 194.87171000000012
b = 'True'
c = False

'a is of type float, b in of type str, c is of type bool'
